## Introduction
**Python Individual** is a project which bases on a Maschine Learning project on Capital Bike Sharing in Washington DC. The Task was to reproduce the initial project using Dask in order to get a feeling and enhance the knowledge on parallel computing. 

Most of the files are saved in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Hofi45/ie-python-individual) 
The dataset can be accessed at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/marklvl/bike-sharing-dataset)
For ease of use, the dataset is also loaded into a seperate Gist so that when running the notebook, the download of the dataset runs automatically.

## Installation

In order to be able to run the Jupyter Notebook, some preliminary installations have to be performed.

To install the necessary packages with Terminal (macOS):

* Run `pip install dask_ml`
* Run `pip install cluster`  
* Check if the package has been installed using `conda list`  

To install the necessary packages with command prompt (windows):
Supposing that Python3 is installed and running
* Run `python -m pip install dask`
* Run `python -m pip install dask_ml`
* Run `python -m pip install cluster`
* Check if the package has been installed using `python -m conda list`

To install the necessary packages with Anaconda Prompt:
